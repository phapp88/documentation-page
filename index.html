        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.x. having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).  There are also more advanced server side versions of javascript such as Node.Js which allow you to add more functionality to a website than simply downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
        <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as <code>Array</code>, <code>Date</code>, and <code>Math</code>, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
          <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the webpage (DOM) looks. And, likewise, Node.js JavaScript on the server can respond to custom requests from code written in the browser.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="Hello_World" class="main-section">
        <header><h2>Hello World</h2></header>
        <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
        <pre><code>
          (function(){
            "use strict";
            /* Start of your code */
            function greetMe(yourName) {
              alert('Hello ' + yourName);
            }
            
            greetMe('World');
            /* End of your code */
          })();
        </code></pre>
        <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser! In the following pages, this guide will introduce you to the JavaScript syntax and language features, so that you will be able to write more complex applications. But, for the time being, remember to always include the <code>(function(){"use strict";</code> before your code, and add <code>})();</code> to the end of your code. You will learn what these mean, but for now they can be thought of as doing the following —</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Massively improve performance</li>
          <li>Prevent stupid semantics in JavaScript that trip up beginners</li>
          <li>Prevent code snippets executed in the console from interacting with one-another (e.g. having something created in one console execution being used for a different console execution).</li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section id="Comments" class="main-section">
        <header><h2>Comments</h2></header>
        <p>The syntax of <b>comments</b> is the same as in C++ and in many other languages:</p>
        <pre><code>
          // a one line comment
           
          /* this is a longer, 
           * multi-line comment
           */
           
          /* You can't, however, /* nest comments */ SyntaxError */
        </code></pre>
        <p>Comments behave like whitespace and are discarded during script execution.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
        <header><h2>Variables</h2></header>
        <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
        <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
        <p>You can use most of ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers (for more details see <a href="https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-identifiers-es6" target="_blank">this blog post</a>). You can also use the Unicode escape sequences</a> as characters in identifiers.</p>
        <p>Some examples of legal names are <code>Number_hits</code>, <code>temp99</code>, <code>$credit</code>, and <code>_name</code>.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="Declaring_Variables" class="main-section">
        <header><h2>Declaring Variables</h2></header>
        <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>With the keyword <code>var</code>. For example, <code>var x = 42</code>. This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</li>
          <li>By simply assigning it a value. For example, <code>x = 42</code>. If this form is used outside of a function, it declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</li>
          <li>With the keyword <code>let</code>. For example, <code>let y = 13</code>. This syntax can be used to declare a block-scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section id="Variable_Scope" class="main-section">
        <header><h2>Variable Scope</h2></header>
        <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a <em>global</em> variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a <em>local</em> variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
        <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the <em>function (or global scope)</em> that the block resides within. For example the following code will log <code>5</code>, because the scope of <code>x</code> is the function (or global context) within which <code>x</code> is declared, not the block, which in this case is an <code>if</code> statement.</p>
        <pre><code>
          if (true) {
            var x = 5;
          }
          console.log(x);  // x is 5
        </code></pre>
        <p>This behavior changes, when using the <code>let</code> declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
        <pre><code>
          if (true) {
            let y = 5;
          }
          console.log(y);  // ReferenceError: y is not defined
        </code></pre>
